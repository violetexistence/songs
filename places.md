# SPHERES OF INFLUENCE IN FERELDEN

Spheres of influence represent important and noteworthy regions, resources, and structures within Ferelden. Each sphere includes multiple contacts of potential value to the bard. Any time your song acquires a new Sphere of Influence, you will choose any one contact that is *loyal* to the bard (this does not render them beyond manipulation)

You receives the other contacts for your sphere as well, though they do not start off loyal. In addition, the bard may undertake a **long-term project**, wooing any of the below contacts without holding the Sphere of Influence of which they are part.

Each faction on the list of *Those Who Rule* has a number of Spheres of Influence based on its ranking.

## Kinloch Hold <a name="kinloch_hold"></a>
The Circle Tower, officially named **Kinloch Hold**, is Ferelden’s regional headquarters for the Circle of Magi. It is located on Lake Calenhad, and accessed only by its docks. As per Chantry and local law, human and elf citizens of Ferelden with magical potential are brought here to be imprisoned for most of their lives and instructed in the legally approved Schools of Magic, and (ideally) trained to resist demons (who seek especially to possess living mages).

Contacts: **Ines**, an Enchanter; **Hadley**, a Knight Templar; **Humbert**, a Tranquil

Faction with Holding: **Schola Lucrosia**, **The Divine**

Perks: *Doctore Retinues** and **Colleagues** gain **+1 potency**. Access to the depth of knowledge found in the tower’s libraries cannot be overstated.

## Gherlin’s Pass <a name="gherlin_pass"></a>
**Gherlin*’s Pass** is the overland gateway to Ferelden from the west, where the Imperial Highway wends its way through the **Frostback Mountains**. It is considered to be a safer if more lengthy route than taking Sulcher’s Pass. It is the only option for year round passage. The entrance to the dwarven realm Orzammar is also found here.

Contacts: **Jeka**, a Casteless; **Ottokar**, a Bounty Hunter; **Myarav**, a Gate Guard

Faction with Holding: **Deshyr Trade Assembly**

Perks: **+1d** to **gather information** regarding comings and goings within Ferelden. Take **+1** to your **engagement roll** when acting on that information. News from Orlais typically comes to Ferelden through Gherlin’s Pass.

## Imperial Highway <a name="imperial_highway"></a>
**Imperial Highways** are the largest infrastructure asset in Ferelden. Constructed of stone and magic by the Tevinter Imperium during the Ancient Age, it connects the region with the rest of Thedas, west over Gherlen’s Pass and into Orlais. In Ferelden, the highway circles Lake Calenhad and the Bannorn, with one branch ending in Denerim and the other at Ostagar, its southernmost point. Soldiers, paid mercenaries mainly, patrol the Imperial Highway in Ferelden and protect dozens of outposts which are crucial to supplying the Orlesian occupying force.

Contacts: **de’Rossi**,* a Quartermaster; **Rostam** an Stonemason; **Aurelio**, a Traveling Merchant

Faction with Holding: **Blackstone Irregulars**

Perks: **+2d** to **Transport Engagements**. There are few places in the Ferelden inaccessible by Imperial Highways.

## Brecilian Passage <a name="brecilian_passage"></a>
**The Brecilian Forest** is a large forest in south-eastern Ferelden. It is a favorite hiding place for Dalish elf clans and according to some Dalish legends, was a revered place for the ancient elves. Most humans believe that the deaths of countless ancient battles have torn the veil which separates the Fade and the real world. Its sinister air and possessed flora have led to many rumors and stories behind the ancient woods. The only way to reach the human teyrnir of Gwaren is by sea or to risk traveling the Brecilian Passage.

Contacts: **Bellanaris**, a Dalish Wanderer; **Sister**, a Forest Spirit; **Cormac**, a Seeker of Relics

Faction with Holding: **Dreadwolf**

Perks: **+1 result level** for **Alchemical Crafting**. **+1d on **engagement rolls** for stealth and arcane errands in this location.
