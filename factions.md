# THOSE WHO RULE

## The Divine
**Tier 6** <br />
At the head of the Chantry is the Divine, who leads from her seat in the Grand Cathedral in Val Royeaux. Below her are the Left and Right Hands of the Divine. These are her personal agents and act as her voice is she is not otherwise present.

The Chantry is the dominant religious faith in Thedas. With so much influence among its people, the Chantry can exert considerable political pressure on the ruling classes in many areas of concern. 

The Chantry's faith is rooted in four core principles.
* Magic is a corrupting influence in the world.
* Humankind's sin of pride destroyed the Golden City and created the darkspawn.
* Adraste was the bride of the Maker, a prophet and martyr.
* Humankind has sinned and must seek penance to earn the Maker's forgiveness.

**NPCs:** **Faustine II**, The Divine (*progressive, proud, demanding*); **Jaeneve**, The Left Hand (*toothesome, festive, sharp*); **Michel**, The Right Hand (*glamorous, petite, guarded*); **Cerise Montfort**, Successor (*sweltering, acceptable, parismonious*)

**Notable Assets:** The Grand Cathedral, All Lyrium Supply Outside Orzammar, Right of Annulment, Donations and Tithes Across Thedas

**Reputation:** The Emperor is in control of Orlais, but The Divine controls the minds of faithful all over Thedas. On occassion The Divine may play the Grand Game, even play it well, but the Chantry itself carefully avoids feeding the idea. Their meddling happens through private audiences with The Left Hand or else directly when maleficarum is involved.

**Enemies:** The Argent Spire

**Allies:** The Templar Order, The Seekers of Truth, Most Devout Heads of State

**Situation:** Any request for aid from The Chantry comes with strings attached. It is well known that Faustine II wants her legacy to be improving the lives of elves. The Left Hand performs assessments. The Divine recommends improvements. The Right Hand ensures those improvments are unimpeded. Faustine is advanced in age and has already named her successor, Cerise Montfort . It is rumored that the successor already operates as The Divine in all but name.

**Short Term Objective:** Rights for all elves.

**Long Term Objective:** Spread the Chant of Light to all four corners of the world and to all races.
