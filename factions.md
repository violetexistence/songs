## The Divine <a name="the-divine"></a>
**Tier 6** <br />
At the head of the Chantry is the Divine, who leads from her seat in the Grand Cathedral in Val Royeaux. Below her are the Left and Right Hands of the Divine. These are her personal agents and act as her voice is she is not otherwise present.

The Chantry is the dominant religious faith in Thedas. With so much influence among its people, the Chantry can exert considerable political pressure on the ruling classes in many areas of concern. 

The Chantry's faith is rooted in four core principles.
* Magic is a corrupting influence in the world.
* Humankind's sin of pride destroyed the Golden City and created the darkspawn.
* Andraste was the bride of the Maker, a prophet and martyr.
* Humankind has sinned and must seek penance to earn the Maker's forgiveness.

**NPCs:** **Faustine II**, The Divine (*progressive, proud, demanding*); **Jaeneve**, The Left Hand (*toothesome, festive, sharp*); **Michel**, The Right Hand (*glamorous, petite, guarded*); **Cerise Montfort**, Successor (*sweltering, acceptable, parismonious*)

**Notable Assets:** The Grand Cathedral, All Lyrium Supply Outside Orzammar, Right of Annulment, Donations and Tithes Across Thedas

**Reputation:** The Emperor is in control of Orlais, but The Divine controls the minds of faithful all over Thedas. On occassion The Divine may play the Grand Game, even play it well, but the Chantry itself carefully avoids feeding the idea. Their meddling happens through private audiences with The Left Hand or else directly when maleficarum is involved.

<hr />

**Enemies:** The Argent Spire

**Allies:** The Templar Order, The Seekers of Truth, Most Devout Heads of State

<hr />

**Situation:** Any request for aid from The Chantry comes with strings attached. It is well known that Faustine II wants her legacy to be improving the lives of elves. The Left Hand performs assessments. The Divine recommends improvements. The Right Hand ensures those improvments are unimpeded. Faustine is advanced in age and has already named her successor, Cerise Montfort . It is rumored that the successor already operates as The Divine in all but name.

**Short Term Objective:** Rights for all elves.

**Long Term Objective:** Spread the Chant of Light to all four corners of the world and to all races.

## House Valmont <a name="house-valmont"></a>
**Tier 5** <br />
The royal family of Orlais, the House of Valmont has placed one of its scions on the Imperial since the end of the Exalted Age. Today, in addition to the main royal branch, there are four cadet branches: Montfort, Reynaud, Campana, and de Chalons. 

The current Emperor, Florian, was the second son of Emperor Judicael and was never meant to ascend to the Orlesian throne. His elder brother, Judicael II had two twin sons and was therefore secure in his line. Florian was free to pursue other interests, none of which involved the Grand Game. Most of the Imperial Court ignored him, and that was the way he liked it. An outbreak of the Hundred Days Cough in 8:77 Blessed changed his plans as both of Judicael's sons perished, as did Florian's own daughter. Judicael was thrown off his horse during a fox hunt in 8:84 Blessed, catapulting Florian onto the throne. Famously, his response to the chevaliers delivering the news at his estate is said to be, "*This will not do at all*."

Florian is rumored to have taken his youngest cousin Meghren as lover. Recently, a quarrel between them ended with Florian sending Meghren to govern the rebellious province of Ferelden as punishment for his offense.

**NPCs:** **Meghren**, King of Ferelden (*messy, pink, needy*); **Felix**, Commander of Imperial Forces (*inquisitive, wooden, divergent*); **Severan**, Court Mage (*reflective, impolite, savory*)

**Notable Assets:** Royal Palace, Chevaliers, Dozens of Outposts on the Imperial Highway

**Reputation:** "Good King" Meghren is a seen as an effete puppet. The more he attempts to win the love and respect of Fereldens by aping their customs, the more they despise him. Paying respect to House Valmont in public continues to be the best politics, however, since Orlesian power remains the dominant force in Ferelden.

**Enemies:** House Theirin

**Allies:** House Hightower, Blackstone Irregulars

**Situation:** The outlaw knight, Ser Gareth of Oswin, has been leading raids against outposts in the Southern Bannorn. Fearing he cannot trust anyone who is not a blooded scion of Valmont, King Meghren has entrusted the outlaw's capture to his own cousin, Felix.

**Short Term Objective:** Capture Ser Gareth and put an end to the raids.

**Long Term Objective:** Earn the trust and respect of the Ferelden people.

## Deshyr Trade Assembly <a name="#deshyr-trade-assembly"></a>
**Tier 4** <br />
The Deshyr are a powerful and extensively connected guild comprised of surface dwarves. Some of the guild's members left the dwarven city of Orzammar to pursue business and trade on the surface while others joined after being exiled from the city. The Deshyr's leaders can always trace their lineage back to the Noble and Merchant houses in Orzammar. Its main role is to regulat trade between Orzammar and the surface.

The upper-class surface dwarf members of the Deshyr are composed of two distinct groups: the **kalna** who insist on maintaining caste and rank and **ascendant** who believe in leaving Orzammar's traditions behind and embracing surface life.

**NPCs:** **Bianca Davri**, a Kalna Smith (*versed, damaged, secretive*); **Bartrand Tethras**, Ascendant Negotiator (*outrageous, massive, disillusioned*); **Dusan Vasca**, Noble Scion (*successful, peaceful, tenuous*)

**Notable Assets:** Lyrium Trade, Ander Artisans, Maps of the Deep Roads

**Reputation:** The line between respactable dwarven merchant and criminal carta thug can be tenuous. Officially, the Deshyr engage in legitimate trade only. However, it is well known that contraband and illicit services are available for a price to their loyal clients. The Deshyr are ambitious, business-minded operators, with eyes for long term opportunity. They keep contracts with individuals, not governments. There is always a price to buy themselves out of such contracts, in the event they become a liability. This helps them mitigate more disastrous political entanglements.

<hr />

**Enemies:** Bank of Brass and Bone

**Allies:** The Ironmongers, Legion of the Dead, Various Independent Traders

<hr />

**Situation:** The Deshyr Trade Assembly's influence in Ferelden has grown from a handful of routes throughout Thedas to a financial powerhouse, bringing in goods from the far reaches of the world and commanding exorbinant prices. If they can secure the trade lanes to Antiva it will afford them the assets to purchase King Meghren's debt outright, giving them considerable sway with the crown and, therefor, sway over the laws governing trade in Ferelden.

**Short Term Objective:** Establish trade lane to Antiva.

**Long Term Objective:** Buy out debt across Thedas and compete with The Bank of Brass and Bone.
